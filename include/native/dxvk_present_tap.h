/* Apple port (twcclegg/dxvk-native): DXVK present tap for the visionOS compositor (Apple builds only).
 *
 * Off unless LB_PRESENT_TAP=1 is set and a callback is registered. When on, every D3D9 Present also copies the
 * back buffer into one of three tap-owned Vulkan images, inside DXVK's own command list, so it is ordered after
 * the frame. Then the callback runs on the presenting (game) thread with that image.
 *
 * Consumer contract:
 *  - The callback must not block. Hand the frame to the compositor thread.
 *  - Before reading the image, call dxvk_present_tap_wait(frame->state, frame->frame_id). It blocks until
 *    the GPU has finished the frame (DXVK's CPU-side frame fence).
 *  - Export the image's MTLTexture once per image with vkExportMetalObjectsEXT (VkExportMetalTextureInfoEXT,
 *    .image = frame->vk_image). Images only change when frame->state changes (back-buffer resize).
 *  - Never submit to vk_queue: DXVK owns it.
 *  - Call dxvk_present_tap_release(frame->state, frame->slot) once the compositor's read of the slot has
 *    completed on the GPU. Until then DXVK won't write that slot again. If all slots are held, DXVK
 *    skips the tap for that frame and never stalls the game.
 *  - dxvk_present_tap_ready() is the non-blocking form of _wait, for a compositor that must never miss its
 *    own deadline: take a frame only when it reports ready, otherwise re-present the previous one.
 *
 * Tap-only (exclusive) mode: while the runtime says the immersive layer is running
 * (dxvk_present_tap_set_exclusive(1)) AND a callback is registered AND LB_PRESENT_TAP=1, DXVK skips the WSI
 * swapchain entirely: no acquire, blit or present to the SDL window's CAMetalLayer, which may be hidden and
 * stall. It still records the tap copy and the frame fence. Pacing then comes from the runtime's present pacing,
 * not vsync. The environment variable alone never engages it, and exclusive starts off.
 * Clear it (set_exclusive(0)) before or together with clearing the callback when the immersive layer stops.
